# What's this?

This is a simple To-Do List made with React.  
It served as a live coding example during the first [Webdev Zwolle meetup](https://www.meetup.com/webdevzwolle/).

# Goal

The goal of this coding session was to 
* Illustrate how React works in general
* Show off JSX
* Show off a bit of ES6 magic
* Show different ways to declare components
* Show how to manage state
* Show how to communicate between component through props

# How to run?
